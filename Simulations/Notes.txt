	- Parameter names CANNOT start with numbers

TODO:


	Current Work
	------------

	* Up/Down probability for BinomialTreeSimulation
	* Enhance BinomialTreeSimulationResults
	* BinomialTreeSimulationParameter for use in standard Simulation (takes summary statistic)
	* Use BinomialTree to calculate FV of a derivative?
	* Constant movement parameter --> e.g. from 1 to 2 over time period (allow different interpolation types/random path between?)

	* Brownian Motion / Black-Scholes model

	

	Planned / Keep in mind
	----------------------

	- Figure out how to handle different number types (make everything FloatingPoint?)

	- Sensivity builder
		> Use another parameter to generate a precomputed parameter that can be used in a sensitivity analysis

	- Formula parameters
		> essentially just simulation parameters that are prebuilt from templates

	- Optimization simulation
		> use equation to min/max a variable or outcome

	- Validate expression before running simulation?
		> Split out non-variable characters and verify remaining variables have matching paramerters

	- Allow access to individual parameters inside results sets as their own result set
		> can verify that they were generated correctly

	- Make it easier to regenerate individual parameters in results sets
		> currently have to replace parameter with itself

	- Use confidence interval as a result parameter from a simulation?

	- Find a way to remove dynamic cast?
		> maybe by checking the distribution interface to see what type of values it will generate?

	- Handle rare case in binomial tree where a node could overlap a node in the same generation that wasn't the last generated node?
		> not sure how this would actually happen... but maybe using some janky dynamic volatility parameter
